# Sokol Notes

Just notes on the the set of libraries from : [floooh/sokol](https://github.com/floooh/sokol)

Much of my notes are in [pureref](https://www.pureref.com) files. I perfer to compose a canvas overview of a large files to digest them.

There will be markdown files of related canvases where I linearly screencap and provide some notable inormation derived from them.
